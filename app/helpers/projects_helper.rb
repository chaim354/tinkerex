# than each partial reaching into the layout, so a title's fallback and an intro's markup are
# written once for the maker's page and the visitor's. The LAYOUT IS AN ARGUMENT: the maker's page
# holds @panel_layout, the public page holds `pub.layout`, and the shared projects/_wiring partial
# is handed whichever it is rendering for as a local.
