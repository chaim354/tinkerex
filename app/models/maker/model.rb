module Maker
  # A 3D-print model in the catalog: a cover, metadata, its files (via the polymorphic
  # FileAttachment), tags, and a print log. Distinct from Maker::Project (a build). Its files
  # live at Models/<slug>/ in the ordinary file library — this record is a curated view over
  # them, so nothing here touches sync/changelog/mounts (§10).
