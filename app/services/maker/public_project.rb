  # EVERYTHING A PUBLIC PAGE MAY SHOW, DERIVED ONCE (stage 3, S3-4; spec §2.5, §2.6). The page and
  # the file route both ask this object, so "is this file public" has ONE answer. That is the whole
  # reason it exists: a page that decided what to render and a route that decided what to deliver
  # would be two spellings of one rule, and the pair that drifts is the pair where a file is
  # linked on the page and 404s, or worse is delivered while nothing links it.
  #
  # PERMISSION IS BY ANCESTRY OR BY ATTACHMENT, NEVER BY THE CAPPED LISTING. A file past
  # ProjectFolderListing::FILE_CAP, or inside a repository the DIR_CAP walk never entered, is not
  # rendered on the page — but a README's own link to it must still resolve, and a visitor who was
  # handed that URL must still get the bytes. Ancestry (a live file whose parent chain reaches the
  # project folder) is what says so; attachment (a maker_file_attachments row on the project or on
  # one of its build-log entries) covers the Linked file and the entry photo that live ELSEWHERE in
  # the library and are still the project's.
  #
  # IT READS THE OWNER'S LIBRARY IN THE OWNER'S NAME. Every port call and every query below is
  # scoped to `project.user`, who is not the person making the request — a visitor has no library
  # of their own for a node_id to resolve against. Nothing here consults a session; the controllers
  # above it cannot (Public::BaseController stands on ActionController::Base).
